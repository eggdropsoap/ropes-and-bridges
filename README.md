Ropes and Bridges
=================

Ropes and rope bridges mod for Minecraft.

This adds rope bridges that use a free-hanging rope equation to give
a realistic curve to the bridge. Craft a specific length of bridge and
hang it between two points that length or less apart, and you will have
a nice, aesthetically-pleasing rope bridge.
